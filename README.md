## Overview

Hi! This is the first Frontend Mentor challenge I'm tackling after being stranded in 'tutorial hell' for several months.

For this QR code component, I used semantic HTML5 and CSS, with Flexbox for positioning elements. I initially thought of using SASS for writing up my styling, but I decided that I wanted to work on being able to write pure CSS as neatly as possible.

## My process

The first thing I did was look at the markup and tweak it by changing some of the tags to be more semantic, and adding class names. My personal styling methodology is a preference for classes as opposed to targeting tags or IDs.

For the styling, I started off declaring all my base styles before moving on to styling the elements, and then fixing spacing, positioning and sizing after.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS variables
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

How to center a "div". ðŸ˜…

Centering small elements horizontally and vertically on a page are something I'm prone to overthinking about, as most of my previous practice has involved creating long webpages. I went with using Flexbox to achieve this. Big fan of Flexbox. ðŸŒ¹
